                    <h2>More about user research</h2>
                    <p>
                        Users and their behaviors are my main source of inspiration as a designer. The search for knowledge and inspiration challenges my imagination and triggers my creativity.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        I use various methods to engage users such as context mapping, cultural probes, creative sessions, semi-structured interviews, interactive questionnaires and observations. I evaluate designs and concepts through usability and user experience testing. For market research I do competitive analyses, competitor reviews and case studies.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Context mapping</h3>
                        <p>
                            I use creative materials and exercises to reach a deeper understanding for implicit and tacit user needs. Sensitizing materials allows for self-reflection and prepares the participants for a creative session where main insights are gathered.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Cultural Probes</h3>
                        <p>
                            I use small design packages to quickly gather inspirational data about people’s lives, behaviors and values. Depending on the topic, I create maps, postcards, dairies etc. along with a few fun tasks that I send to (and later collect from) my participants

                        <p>
                            I facilitate small groups in brainstorming and creativity. Models, posters, concepts etc. are made and presented while I guide the participants through generative exercises and motivate them to share their views, thoughts and feelings around a specific topic.

                        <h3>Usability testing</h3>
                        <p>
                            I evaluate potential usability problems by measuring criteria such as learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and user satisfaction in relation to a product or service. During the test I present participants with realistic scenarios and ask them to perform specific tasks while observations are made, notes are taken and measurements (time to complete a task, effort ratings ect.) are recorded.

                        <h3>UX evaluation</h3>
                        <p>
                            User experiences are subjective, context-dependent and changing over time. It is therefore important to measure user’s perception of a system before, during as well as after interacting with it. I use techniques such as observations, think-out-loud protocols, EmoCards and AttrakDiff questionnaires to evaluate the User experience.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Interviews</h3>
                        <p>
                            I often use semi-structured interviews in combination with other methods to further deepen my understanding and allow participants to express additional thoughts. The method allows for the flexibility needed and motivates the type of communication that is necessary, especially when discussing more sensitive subjects.

                        <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
                        <p>
                            I make competitive reviews to determine how a site performs in relation to its competition. Expert reviews or competitive usability tests are made to compare over-all usability metrics or specific features and design elements across different sites. I find this method to be a very good initial research activity. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Competitor review</h3>
                        <p>
                            I like to orient myself in a new field by making a competitor review. Many important insights can be gathered simply by identifying the competition - the size and scope of the market.

                        <p>
                            When investigating a specific, real-life context I get to explore and communicate potentials and boundaries related to it. I find it a great way to inspire new ideas and to serve as a good example to motivate a continued discussion.
