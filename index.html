The search for knowledge and inspiration challenges my imagination and triggers my creativity.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0">I use various methods to engage users such as context mapping, cultural probes, creative sessions, semi-structured interviews, interactive questionnaires and observations. I evaluate designs and concepts through usability and user experience testing. For market research I do competitive analyses, competitor reviews and case studies.</p><div class=grid-item><img src=images/8410ee08.01-user-research_context-mapping_500px.jpg><h3>Context mapping</h3><p>I use creative materials and exercises to reach a deeper understanding for implicit and tacit user needs. Sensitizing materials allows for self-reflection and prepares the participants for a creative session where main insights are gathered.</p><p class=example>More about the method (<a target=_blank href=http://www.maketools.com/articles-papers/Contextmapping_SleeswijkVisseretal_05.pdf>Sleeswijk Visser et al, 2005</a>)</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/0d788a21.01-user-research_cultural-probes_500px.jpg><h3>Cultural Probes</h3><p>I use small design packages to quickly gather inspirational data about people’s lives, behaviors and values. Depending on the topic, I create maps, postcards, dairies etc. along with a few fun tasks that I send to (and later collect from) my participants</p><p class=example>Give me an example.

TU Delft / Wacom : 2012</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/89980d8e.01-user-research_creative-session_500px.jpg><h3>Creative sessions</h3><p>I facilitate small groups in brainstorming and creativity. Models, posters, concepts etc. are made and presented while I guide the participants through generative exercises and motivate them to share their views, thoughts and feelings around a specific topic.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/37cefe64.01-user-research_usability-testing_500px.jpg><h3>Usability testing</h3><p>I evaluate potential usability problems by measuring criteria such as learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and user satisfaction in relation to a product or service. During the test I present participants with realistic scenarios and ask them to perform specific tasks while observations are made, notes are taken and measurements (time to complete a task, effort ratings ect.) are recorded.</p><p class=example>Project Usability and user eXperience Assessment in Design / TU Delft / Oce : 2012</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/f3fdc95f.01-user-research_UX-evaluation_500px.jpg><h3>UX evaluation</h3><p>User experiences are subjective, context-dependent and changing over time. It is therefore important to measure user’s perception of a system before, during as well as after interacting with it. I use techniques such as observations, think-out-loud protocols, EmoCards and AttrakDiff questionnaires to evaluate the User experience.</p><p class=example>Project Usability and user eXperience Assessment in Design / TU Delft / Oc&eacute; : 2012</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/908235b1.01-user-research_interviews_500px.jpg><h3>Interviews</h3><p>I often use semi-structured interviews in combination with other methods to further deepen my understanding and allow participants to express additional thoughts. The method allows for the flexibility needed and motivates the type of communication that is necessary, especially when discussing more sensitive subjects.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/acd2d402.01-user-research_competitive-analysis_500px.jpg><h3>Competitive analysis</h3><p>I make competitive reviews to determine how a site performs in relation to its competition. Expert reviews or competitive usability tests are made to compare over-all usability metrics or specific features and design elements across different sites. I find this method to be a very good initial research activity.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/6ddd06fe.01-user-research_competitor-review_500px.jpg><h3>Competitor review</h3><p>I like to orient myself in a new field by making a competitor review. Many important insights can be gathered simply by identifying the competition - the size and scope of the market.</p><p class=example>See full example.

Analyzing means creating structure in an otherwise chaotic environment. Throughout this process I like to completely emerge myself in the data and for a few days focus completely on understanding and processing the picture described.</p><p>Analyzing qualitative data is a step-wise process, and it starts by transcribing the data. Video and audio materials are studied and all participant comments are noted down in transcripts. The transcripts are further explored and especially interesting quotes are highlighted. The researcher thereafter makes an interpretation of each quote, turning it into a user insight. The interpretations and their associated user quotes are put together and clustered according to various criteria. The exploration continues by organizing the clusters while identifying patterns and/or conflicts in the information.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0">Quantitative data is typically converted into diagrams and compared to baseline values or previous test results made.</p><div class=tell-me-less><span class=back>&lt;</span><span class=text>back</span></div></div></div></div><div class=side-page data-side-page=communicate><div class=page><div class=inner-page><div class=tell-me-less><span class=back>&lt;</span><span class=text>back</span></div><h2>communicate</h2><p>User insights are nice – but useless on their own. I get to use all my creativity when bringing them alive. The mediums I use depend on the information I strive to convey and the people I am talking with. Each method supports the concept development process and communication with stakeholders in a different way. The overall purpose is to motivate consistent design decisions throughout the design &amp; development cycle.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0">I often start on a abstract, conceptual level - mapping out business strategies and overall goals. I thereafter bring the high-level ideas to more and more detail, describing the users and their behaviors &amp; needs in the form of personas, customer journeys and storyboards.</p><div class=grid-item><img src=images/310583e2.05-communicate_strategy-diagram_500px.jpg><h3>Strategy diagram</h3><p>A good user experience starts with a clearly defined strategy, which leads to a good understanding for and communication of underlying goals. This can be in the form of infographics describing higher-level company visions or business models.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/f6ebe62b.05-communicate_conceptual-model_500px.jpg><h3>Conceptual model</h3><p>A conceptual model helps in developing a clear concept vision. If done well, the model can help users create a correct understanding for the overall behavior of the solution. I use the method early on in the design process and often implement metaphors or descriptive illustrations to demonstrate my ideas.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/a78e0a75.05-communicate_metaphor_500px.jpg><h3>Metaphor</h3><p>I use metaphors as a way to create a mental picture and give a ‘personality’ to the product I am developing. The metaphor guides me in the entire design process and can support the decision making process in a similar way as personas do.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/90e4ceae.05-communicate_persona_500px.jpg><h3>Persona</h3><p>By creating user profiles I give your users a name and face within the company. Such a seemingly small thing can greatly support a more user-focused work process and enable discussions where the end-user is directly taken into account.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/e9dc3eb1.05-communicate_user-scenario_500px.jpg><h3>User scenario</h3><p>Typical user situations can be described in user scenarios. It is a simple method for conveying user needs and experiences while adding context to your personas.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/bd8efc6c.05-communicate_storyboard_500px.jpg><h3>Storyboard</h3><p>Story telling is great for describing user experiences. I often communicate my stories in the form of storyboards where the user interaction is clearly described with text and images.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/cd35c392.05-communicate_customer-journey_500px.jpg><h3>Costumer journey</h3><p>When I need to map out sequential information I use the method of customer journeys. They are perfect for describing cycles such as changing needs of a user group while also linking these to different types of product interactions.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/b10a4117.05-communicate_mindmap_500px.jpg><h3>Mindmap</h3><p>For illustrating groups of information and their internal relationships, mindmapping works very well. I use it as a creative tool while analyzing as well as communicating insights.</p></div><div class=tell-me-less><span class=back>&lt;</span><span class=text>back</span></div></div></div></div><div class=side-page data-side-page=conceptualize><div class=page><div class=inner-page><div class=tell-me-less><span class=back>&lt;</span><span class=text>back</span></div><h2>conceptualize</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 0">By now I know the problems and the possibilities, the ins and outs of your users.

Cut it down to the essentials and create something awesome.</p><div class=grid-item><img src=images/a3230a8f.06-conceptualize_archtecture-diagram_500px.jpg><h3>Architecture diagram</h3><p>I use architecture diagrams or sitemaps to illustrate how a concept is organized and structured. It defines what parts (such as web-pages) are included and how the different content and functionality fit together to form a cohesive whole.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/b341c2fd.06-conceptualize_functional-diagram_500px.jpg><h3>Functional diagram</h3><p>After defining the architecture I often move on to create a more detailed description of the core functionality. What services are provided within each module - what are the specific needs and problems to be fulfilled and solved for the user?</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/6e365920.06-conceptualize_concept-sketches_500px.jpg><h3>Concept sketches</h3><p>In the early idea generation process I use pen and paper to explore different ideas. Quick sketches are perfect as a base for discussion before moving on to digital tools.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/cb0ba662.06-conceptualize_wireframes_500px.jpg><h3>Wireframe</h3><p>I like to work iteratively, in quick development cycles. Digital tools such as Balsamiq or Axure are flexible and allow me to easily update my designs. I use wireframes both as a way to do quick internal testing and to communicate final concepts to the development team.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/b22b7281.06-conceptualize_product-flowchart_500px.jpg><h3>Product flowchart</h3><p>When communicating my designs to the development team I often include a flowchart describing the relation between different wireframes. This provides a good overview of the entire solution.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/3b961d91.06-conceptualize_interactive-prototype_500px.jpg><h3>Interactive prototype</h3><p>To better understand the user experience and test a solution internally as well as externally before production I make interactive prototypes. A simple interactive prototype describing animations and flows is also a great communication tool.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/0a472fa0.06-conceptualize_physical-prototype_500px.jpg><h3>Physical prototype</h3><p>When working with physical products, prototypes can be made to evaluate size, material, shape etc. I also like to use quick methods such as paper prototyping to quickly simulate a final design (physical as well as digital) and test it early on in the development process.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/819d4aeb.06-conceptualize_expression-board_500px.jpg><h3>Expression board</h3><p>I make various visual boards that serve as inspirations but also as a tool to communicate the expression I aim for in terms of style and interaction.</p></div><div class=grid-item><img src=images/27105244.06-conceptualize_visual-styleguide_500px.jpg><h3>Visual style-guide</h3><p>I am not a graphical designer, but while designing the user experience I also develop ideas for the visual appearance. I make style-guides to communicate my vision and support the visual design process.</p></div><div class=tell-me-less><span class=back>&lt;</span><span class=text>back</span></div></div></div></div><script src=scripts/90cc14f7.vendor.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
