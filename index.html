It is like an exciting puzzle waiting to be solved. The chaos is overwhelming. You want to run away, but you need to let it simmer; let all of it sink in. Only then the <a href=#analyze-details class=tell-me-more>patterns start taking shape</a>.</p></div></div><div class="page communicate-page"><div class=inner-page><h1>Communicate</h1><h2>Summarize and make nice.</h2><p>I would like to tell you a story. It can come in many shapes, each situation will ask for a different voice. User quotes on your coffee cups!<br>Personas in the elevator!<br>Your office walls covered in storyboards?</p><p><a href=#communicate-details class=tell-me-more>What’s your favorite?</a></p></div></div><div class="page conceptualize-page"><div class=inner-page><h1>Conceptualize</h1><h2>Think less, do more.</h2><p>By now I know the problems and the possibilities, the ins and outs of your users.

You could say, I hang on to my Scandinavian roots.</p><p>When I design I try to create something so simple, so intuitive, that it altogether seems… completely obvious.</p></div></div><div class="page process-page"><div class=inner-page><h1>Process</h1><h2>Running a company is not simply about creating innovative solutions.</h2><p>It is also very much about creating a team of motivated and creative people. It's about creating a culture that embraces failing just as much succeeding. It’s about agile &amp; efficient processes, a vision and strategy based on true understanding of your customers. I like to be a driving force in making that happen.</p></div></div><div class="page contact-page" id=contact><a name=contact></a><div class=inner-page><h1>Maria Arvidsson</h1><h2>user experience researcher &amp; designer in Amsterdam</h2><p><i>MSc, BSc</i> Industrial Design Engineering (2007-2013)</p><p class=contact-details><a href=https://twitter.com/millemeters>Twitter</a><br><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/mariaarvidsson>LinkedIn</a><br>arvidsson.maria@gmail.com<br>+31 (0)6 86 20 65 84</p></div></div></div><div class=side-page id=user-research-details><div class=page id=user-research-side-1><div class=inner-page><button class=tell-me-less>Tell me less!</button><h1>User research</h1><h2>It's all about the data's, baby!</h2><p>Here's some text that will explain in detail what I am talking about.
